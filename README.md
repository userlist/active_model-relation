# ActiveModel::Relation

A library that allows querying of collections of Ruby objects, with a similar interface to `ActiveRecord::Relation`.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add active_model-relation

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install active_model-relation

## Usage

Create a new relation by passing the model class and a collection:

```ruby
relation = ActiveModel::Relation.new(Project, [
  Project.new(id: 1, state: 'draft', priority: 1),
  Project.new(id: 2, state: 'running', priority: 2),
  Project.new(id: 3, state: 'completed', priority: 3),
  Project.new(id: 4, state: 'completed', priority: 1)
])
```

Afterwards you can use it (almost) like an `ActiveRecord::Relation`.

```ruby
relation.find(1)
relation.find_by(state: 'draft')
relation.where(state: 'completed')
relation.where.not(state: 'draft')
relation.offset(3)
relation.limit(2)
relation.order(:priority)
relation.order(priority: :asc, state: :desc)
relation.extending(Pagination)
relation.only(:where)
relation.except(:limit, :offset)
```

It's also possible to use method calls for filtering, while still returning a `ActiveModel::Relation`.

```ruby
relation.where {Â |project| project.completed? }
relation.where.not { |project| project.draft? }
```

After including `ActiveModel::Relation::Model`, the library also supports named scope methods on the model class.

```ruby
class Project
  include ActiveModel::Model
  include ActiveModel::Attributes
  include ActiveModel::Relation::Model

  attribute :id, :integer
  attribute :state, :string, default: :draft
  attribute :priority, :integer, default: 1

  def self.completed
    where(state: 'completed')
  end
end

relation.completed
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
